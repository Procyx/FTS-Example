# Find The Solution


**Find the solution** aka **FTS** is a website currently in development which provides a bunch of problems.
The solution of a problem is a code that you have to find by searching in the inputs. This code can be a *sentence, randomly generated characters, of any size, etc...*
All problems are structured in the say way, they are given with **5 informations**:
An *ID*, a *Name*, a *Level*, a list of *Skills required*, and some « *Inputs* ».

* **Name**/**ID** allows you to share and find a problem.
* The **Level** is given as a shape. The difficulty of the problem increase with the number of points in the shape. For example, level *Square* is easier than level *Hexagon*.
So, the easiest level is **Point**, and the hardest is **Circle**.
* The **Skills required** allows you to know if you can resolve this problem. Some problems needs in-depth knowledge on very targeted areas that’s why it is important to check this list before starting a problem. (*Be smart! This list can give you some paths*)
* The **Inputs** are the starting points of  the problem. You have to find the code with these Inputs, *nothing more, nothing less*. An Input can be ~anything~: *Image, Video, Text, File, Raw Data, Music...*

## Levels

Here are the different *levels*, with there **characteristics**:

* **Point** - Easy problems, no traps, no false tracks, accessible to all. Need no more than 1 or 2 steps to be resolved.

* **Line** - The problems and the concepts stay easy, but can need some very basic knowledge.

* **Triangle** - Problems slightly more difficult, with some false tracks (depthless). The concepts used stay fairly basic, although slightly more complex.

* **Square** - Problems requiring more steps and more time to be solved. False tracks can be more elaborated. However the concepts used stay the same.

* **Hexagon** - From the "Hexagon" level, the problems become more complicated. They ask for logical reasoning, as well as good ideas to find the right track.

* **Pentagon** - Problems as complex as "Hexagon", but which require more in-depth knowledge in certain areas, usually mathematics (whose level will be specified in the skills required) and programming.
*To solve these problems you will have to be able to apply your knowledge to advance* (For example, create a program to convert an input to another type of data).

* **X-agon** - The difficulty increase with the number of points in the shape. Difficulties can be in any aspect of the problem (number of steps, traps, knowledge ...).

* **Circle** - This is the highest level of "Find The Solution". Solving these problems will require time, logical reasoning, much thought, advanced IT expertise, and in-depth knowledge across multiple domains.
Some will even need research to solve the many sub-problems (or false tracks).


## Example

A full problem **creation/resolution** is given in this github repository to give you an idea of how it looks/works.
For more informations about **The Tree** (A level *Pentagon* problem) you can read the TREE.md file.

Good luck, and have fun!
